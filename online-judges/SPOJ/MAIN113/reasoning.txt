3*3*3*3 = 3^4 = 81
Non-special strings = total - special strings
Special strings: 6 of them
XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY, ZYX
A string of length 3 fits N-3+1 times in a string of length N
Since there are 6 of these strings, then:
3*(N-3)*(N-3+1)*6 special strings with all strings of length N
N=2 => (2-3+1)*6 => 0*6 => 0
N=4 => 3*(4-3+1)*6 => 2*6*3 => 30
N=5 =>
